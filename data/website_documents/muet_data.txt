Department of Mining Engineering
**If it is not “Grown”, it is “Mined”**
Mining is the second earliest endeavors of the human civilization, granted that agriculture was the first. The two industries ranked together as the primary or basic industries of early civilization.
Mineral sector always plays a vital role for industrial development and economic growth of nations. The demand for minerals of all kinds is higher today than ever before, and it continues to increase as the nations of the world strive to improve their standards of living. Mining Engineering is a highly technical field. Today the challenges of mining are greater than before. Now high-tech techniques are being designed to make tomorrow's mines more productive, safer, and economically successful. Mining engineers are seeking ways to extract essential raw materials without causing undue disturbance to the environment.
Mining provides the mineral resources for society, including coal, metallic & non-metallic minerals, ores, gemstones as well as basic products such as; gravel, limestone, sandstone etc., that are essential for the construction of highways, bridges, power plants, and building foundations. Wherever productive minerals deposits are found in our country, the technical skills of Mining and mineral processing engineers are required.

Office of Research, Innovation & Commercialization (ORIC)
![](https://site.muet.edu.pk/sites/default/files/images/users/24/dceimgbld.jpg)
It is a matter of pleasure for me to introduce the Office of Research, Innovation & Commercialization (ORIC). As all of us know that we used to have three directorates viz. Directorate of Research, Continuing Education and Industrial Liaison which were offering various services to the engineering community, industry and society for example – continuous engineering and technical awareness, communication skills, confidence build measures, strategic and time management skills through organization of various workshops and seminars, arrangement of internships, keeping records of research and tracking citation record of faculty members.
Despite of all this, there were various bottlenecks and improvement was required to achieve the best possible results out of the vested resources of the university. This was only possible through continuous reform and improvements in our research policies, objective oriented relationship with industry and demand bases continuing education courses. One of the most important aspect was the integration of all these services and their commercialization to make a way forward for university’s self-dependence. To achieve all these objectives, we need a strong commitment, monitoring and feedback from various stakeholders including the faculty, students and university management.
Owing to the importance of the aims and objectives of the aforementioned directorates in the improvement of the ranking of this university, recently a new directorate has been established namely Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC). I would like to take this opportunity to share the aims and objectives of the newly established directorate of ORIC as under:
  * Supporting the university’s strategic research directions and policies
  * Increasing and diversifying external research funding
  * Providing the guide-lines to faculty, officials and students of the university for acquiring the various grants
  * Improving recruitment and retention of top faculty
  * Improving transformation of research into the public benefit (patent development)
  * Strengthening university-industry relationships
  * Promoting entrepreneurship, technology-transfer and commercialization activities that energize and support the local and national economy
  * Organization of continual professional development (CPD) courses
  * Effective use of infrastructure, equipment and human resources
  * Enhancement in the university’s endowment fund


In pursuance of above objectives, allow me to inform you that in this short time of its emergence, the directorate has developed the data-base of Ph.D. faculty including their impact factor, citation factor, projects funding and other achievements/contributions, has organized various events on campus and plan to launch two series of Certificate/CPD Courses which will start from 22nd October, 2013 and onwards.
At the end, I request to all the stakeholders of the university and engineering community to please come forward in sharing your ideas, observations and feedback for the betterment of this directorate and ultimately for the future prospectus of MUET, Jamshoro.
God bless us.

# About
# Vice Chancellor's Message
![Dr Tauha Ali](https://www.muet.edu.pk/sites/default/files/images/2025-01/dr-tauha-ali.png)
It is an extreme honor and privilege for me to lead one of the prestigious University of the country as the Vice Chancellor. I have great affection and love for this wonderful institution since my student life here in the year 1989. I started my career as a Site Engineer way back in 1995. However, my passion to serve my Alma mater led me to join this university as a faculty member in 1996 reaching the top echelons as Meritorious Professor in 2018. In 2006, after completing my PhD from Australia, envisaging my dream for Mehran UET, I worked in different administrative capacities such as a Focal Person SFAO, Registrar and Pro Vice Chancellor. My focus since then has been to raise the bar of education & research.
This university is known for producing high quality engineering graduates for many years. By the grace of Almighty Allah, Mehran UET is now considered a distinguished public sector engineering university at the national & international level, ranked 1st in the province of Sindh and 2nd in Pakistan, ranked 351st amongst the top 400 universities of the world ranked by “QS Top World University Ranking”. Having achieved this laurel of success the next milestone is to see Mehran University in the top 100 universities of the world. 
This university provides the best learning environment to its students and researchers. The university has state of the art laboratories for use by the students, faculty and industry. Mehran UET is committed to raise the research quality by employing PhD’s in conventional fields as well as in emerging areas of engineering, science, technology and social sciences. In this context, Mehran UET is fortunate to have wealth of resources of high quality faculty who produce research papers in high impact factor journals.
As a Vice Chancellor of my alma mater, I share a dream, a dream I relish and endeavor to achieve; the dream is to make Mehran a leading university where knowledge is created; economies and communities are built and leaders are produced in different walks of life which will ultimately register the name of Mehran University amongst the top 100 universities of the world. The future belongs to those who believe in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
I as a Vice Chancellor of Mehran UET have the vision to restructure the traditional aspects of teaching and learning towards building harmonious communities, sound economies, and modern patterns of leadership to tackle the challenges faced nationally and globally. 
> "HOPING TO SERVE MORE BETTER TO **MY MEHRAN, MY UNIVERSITY**."
**Prof. Dr. Tauha Hussain Ali**  
Vice Chancellor, Mehran UET

It fulfills the more acute need of the development of the country by producing more qualified Engineers at undergraduate & postgradaute levels. The programmes offered provide technical manpower for the development and production of the Electronic Engineering in the country to provide qualified human resources as engineers and technology experts to develop indigenous capability of planning, designing and executing various projects in Electronic Engineering.
The field of Electronic Engineering encompasses the knowledge of electronic circuits & devices and their applications. The students learn variety of subjects of diverse fields including, Microprocessors & Interfacing, Automation and Robotics, Analog & Digital Communication, Optoelectronics, Wired & Wireless Communications, Signal Processing, Industrial Electronics, Integrated Electronics, Artificial Neural Networks, Instrumentation & Control, Embedded System, Telecommunication System Design & Applications, Sequential Circuit Design, Laser & Fiber Optics, Microwave Engineering, Electromagnetic Waves & Radiating System, Computer Communication & Networking.  
  
The courses taught are regularly updated to keep abreast of new knowledge and development. The students also undertake a project during their final year, which helps them to enhance their capabilities as young design engineers. The department is also equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories. These laboratories are well equipped with latest equipment ranging from basic electronic devices, simulators and trainers to more advanced telecommunications trainers, such as Microwave & Antenna trainers. Excellent course work and due practical experience, provide ample job opportunities to our graduates in both public and private sector organizations, national & multinational companies. There is a huge job market of Electronic Engineers in Middle East, Europe, USA and Canada.
Frequent visits to industries are also organized by the department to acquaint students with practical environment. Specifically internship program is launched in collaboration with local industry during summer break for third year and final year students. In addition to that, students are also encouraged to participate in Seminars, Conferences and Software Competitions, such as IEEEP student seminar, A.Q. Khan Software at national level software competition held annually on and around campus. The department has centrally air-conditioned seminar library named after the late Professor M.D. Makhdoom.

## _What Do Industrial Engineers Do?_
Industrial engineers (IEs) apply science, mathematics, and engineering methods to complex system integration and operations. Because these systems are so large and complex,to have knowledge and skills in a wide variety of disciplines, the ability to work well with people, and a broad, systems perspective. Industrial engineers use their knowledge and skills to improve systematic processes through the use of statistical analysis, interpersonal communication, design, planning, quality control, operations management, computer simulation, and problem solving . In other words the Industrial engineers find ways to eliminate wastefulness in production processes. They devise efficient systems that integrate workers, machines, materials, information, and energy to make a product.
_Career opportunities_
Industrial Engineering is a dynamic rapidly growing profession that provides a wide range of career opportunities. Today’s increasing complexity and scarcity of resources in industry, services and organizations have led to ever broadening employment opportunities for industrial engineers. Industrial engineering graduates achieve a unique background that combines science, mathematics, engineering fundamentals of design and management principles to provide a sound basis for life long career development in professional practice, research, and management.

City & Regional Planning
The Department of City & Regional Planning, Mehran UET, Jamshoro is devoted wholly to research, teaching theoretical courses, and assimilating practical knowledge of City & Regional Planning for a professional career in increasingly diversified fields of City & Regional Planning.
This is the first Department established in the Sindh Province in the year 1992 to complete the shortage of Professional Urban Planners in Sindh and the Country.
To meet the ever-increasing demand for qualified Urban and Regional Planners, to offer a better and pollution-free living environment to the people, to ensure planned growth, and to control and guide future planning activities in urban and rural areas of the country, a full-time four-year course is offered in the field of City and Regional Planning.
The program aims to produce Urban and Regional Planners with the interdisciplinary skills to meet the demands of rapidly increasing cities, which can meet the sustainable development and planning millennium goals.
Keeping in view the baseline curriculum prepared by the National Curriculum Revision Committee constituted by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) the curriculum was revised and updated for 22-Batch and onward batches to bring it in line with local, national, and international requirements and to introduce innovation to ensure the quality of education and uniformity of curriculum in the Pakistani Universities, which is also following the recommendations of the Pakistan Council of Architects and Town Planners (PCATP).
The curriculum is designed in such a way that it involves a wide spectrum of activities regarding the preparation of development plans for villages, towns, cities, and regions. To provide practical knowledge, the study visits to different towns and cities are conducted to collect the primary data about the physical, social, and economic aspects of housing, infrastructure, traffic and transportation, slums and katchi-Abadies, etc. It also involves analysis, preparation, and implementation of proposed policies, programs, and plans for the improvement/upgradation of old urban areas and planned development of new settlements at City and Regional levels.
After qualifying, our graduates can serve the nation as professional Planners in the public sectors, like the Ministry of Planning and Development (Housing and Physical Planning), Ministry of Local Government (Sindh Building Control Authority), Ministry of Communication, Planning Commission of Pakistan, Ministry of Environment, Military Engineering Services (MES) of Pakistan, Private Planning and Development Consultant Firms and non-profit research organizations.
The Department of City & Regional Planning has played a vital role not only in Town Planning Education but also in the development of Urban Research in the Country.

Office of Research, Innovation & Commercialization (ORIC)
![](https://site.muet.edu.pk/sites/default/files/images/users/24/dceimgbld.jpg)
It is a matter of pleasure for me to introduce the Office of Research, Innovation & Commercialization (ORIC). As all of us know that we used to have three directorates viz. Directorate of Research, Continuing Education and Industrial Liaison which were offering various services to the engineering community, industry and society for example – continuous engineering and technical awareness, communication skills, confidence build measures, strategic and time management skills through organization of various workshops and seminars, arrangement of internships, keeping records of research and tracking citation record of faculty members.
Despite of all this, there were various bottlenecks and improvement was required to achieve the best possible results out of the vested resources of the university. This was only possible through continuous reform and improvements in our research policies, objective oriented relationship with industry and demand bases continuing education courses. One of the most important aspect was the integration of all these services and their commercialization to make a way forward for university’s self-dependence. To achieve all these objectives, we need a strong commitment, monitoring and feedback from various stakeholders including the faculty, students and university management.
Owing to the importance of the aims and objectives of the aforementioned directorates in the improvement of the ranking of this university, recently a new directorate has been established namely Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC). I would like to take this opportunity to share the aims and objectives of the newly established directorate of ORIC as under:
  * Supporting the university’s strategic research directions and policies
  * Increasing and diversifying external research funding
  * Providing the guide-lines to faculty, officials and students of the university for acquiring the various grants
  * Improving recruitment and retention of top faculty
  * Improving transformation of research into the public benefit (patent development)
  * Strengthening university-industry relationships
  * Promoting entrepreneurship, technology-transfer and commercialization activities that energize and support the local and national economy
  * Organization of continual professional development (CPD) courses
  * Effective use of infrastructure, equipment and human resources
  * Enhancement in the university’s endowment fund


In pursuance of above objectives, allow me to inform you that in this short time of its emergence, the directorate has developed the data-base of Ph.D. faculty including their impact factor, citation factor, projects funding and other achievements/contributions, has organized various events on campus and plan to launch two series of Certificate/CPD Courses which will start from 22nd October, 2013 and onwards.
At the end, I request to all the stakeholders of the university and engineering community to please come forward in sharing your ideas, observations and feedback for the betterment of this directorate and ultimately for the future prospectus of MUET, Jamshoro.
God bless us.
Director, ORIC
